Welcome !
This is an implementation of the classic tic-tac-toe game using friendly animal characters!
The rules are exactly the same. First person to occupy 3 squares in a row WINS.

### Features
* 2 players
* Visual scoreBoard
* Display showing who's next move it is and the status of play.


### Technologies used
* GIMP
* Atom
* Google Chrome
* Google

### Approach taken
* I took turns working on the javascript and css, to take a break and think about what i needed to do
in the other area


### Installation instructions
* Installation is not required to play the game however if you want to get the code you can get it from
my github repository here https://github.com/deancoopercode/tictactoe


### Unsolved Problems

* Couldn't get the bird animation to overflow property without stretching the page.
* Need to refactor duplicate code done for the AI logic.
